## BlackJack practice-Project
#### This project is made because I like many different kinds of card games, and BlackJack is one of them. 

## How does the game work?
- The game has no bet, so you can play as many times as you want. The dealer will deal two cards face up to each player(only one versus one in this project), and one card face up and one face down to themselves.
- Then you can decide to hit or stand, meaning take another card or not respectively. The goal of this game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. If the two cards have the same value, we can split them into two separate hands.
- After players have completed their turn, the dealer reveals their two cards. If the dealer's hand is 16 or less they must hit until hand totals 17 or more. If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, they bust and the remaining players win. If the dealer stands on 17 or higher the dealers will compared to each player's hand to determine the winner.
- The player wins if their hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21, or if the dealer busts. If the player's hand is equal to the dealer's, it's a push. (Tie)
